# About this branch

The test mod at branch [master](https://github.com/xfally/x-ionic-seed/tree/master) has shown some features of ionic, angular and cordova.

This branch is created to demonstrate more interesting features.

Read [README.md](./README.md) to learn how to start and run the HybridApp seed, then you can try all demo.

> Note: This feature/demo branch is the only public feature branch, but it's created for demo, so will never be merged to develop or master in principle.
